## Stuff

* val/var/def/lazy
* String/Int
* object/trait/class (abstract?)
* Constructor and public values
* The apply method / everything is a function (e.g. +)
* Companion object
* case class
* apply / copy
* Tuples
* ScalaTest
* sbt
* sbt run / sbt test
* open sbt console
* open idea scratch

## Excercise

- Write a case class containing a position and a username (both are strings)
    - Write a function to replace the position
    - Obviously with tests (verify the original case class wasn't changed)
    - add a counter field that counts how many times the object changed position
- Add a new case class that only contains the username
    - both case classes need to implement the same trait (trait contains the username)
